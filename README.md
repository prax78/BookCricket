BookCricket android app






 







Hi Friends,

Please find link to download small android app called "Book Cricket".
I hope most of 80s and 90's Indian school going kids must have played book cricket.
during school days we used to play cricket using books.
Rule of game was to flip book pages and even pages are added to total score.
For example, if I  flip a book and stop randomly at particular page and page number shows 34,so 4 will be added to my total and if 10,20 etc comes (which ends with 0) will be taken as wickets.
So game will continue till 10 wickets are counted, till then other numbers will be added to score.

I have setup this app on this logic and instead of flipping book pages to generate random numbers, "FLIP" button will do the same.
0 will be taken as wicket and game will continue till 10 wickets are fallen.
Reset button will reset game and re-enable "FLIP" button.
I hope people will enjoy this one.
